# mea-analysis-timkolab
6/27/2020
This repository was created to analyze multi electrode arrays, by the Timko lab at Tufts University.
The code is written in python, with some use of the jupyter notebook,
and depends on a module called "spikeinterface". https://github.com/SpikeInterface
It is designed to run on the Tufts cluster, and as such, it does not have automatic installation
of the dependencies, and might not run on other platforms without some modification.
